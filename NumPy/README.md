# NumPy Guide

This folder contains my learning notes, examples, and practice notebooks for **NumPy**, one of the most powerful numerical computing libraries in Python.

---

##  What’s Included

- Introduction to NumPy  
- Creating arrays (1D, 2D, 3D)  
- Array indexing and slicing  
- Mathematical operations  
- Array reshaping and manipulation  
- Useful NumPy functions  
- Statistics with NumPy  
- Random module

##  Notebook  
All explanations and code are included in the Jupyter Notebook:

1.  **numpy_intro_and_basics.ipynb**

2.  **Array_Creation_and_Operations.ipynb**

3.  **Advanced_NumPy_for_Data_Analysis_and_ML.ipynb**

Hey! Some topics in the 3rd notebook are the same as in the 2nd notebook, but I included extra examples, advanced parts, and more explanation for better understanding. 🙂

This notebook is written in a beginner-friendly way with explanations for each concept.

##  Purpose  
- To document my NumPy learning journey  
- To create easy-to-understand resources for others  
- To build a strong foundation for Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Machine Learning
